Dynamically Constructed Prepare Statements

The included files are all of the .php and sql files required to run my website.
The database is currently in shende's private server, the database name is: rgbooth_db.

The majority of the data used is from the Dragon Research Collaborative, which I already had access to through my internship.
This data is constructed by running the file dragonBaseQuery.sql. This query will delete all tables that it will attempt to create before creating them,
effectively reseting the database, wiping all data that has been inserted through the website queries.
I did create an additional table called test, and it is constructed identically to the DragonBase tables by running the file preptest.sql
